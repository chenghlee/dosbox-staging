Description: DOS/x86 emulator with advanced features
 DOSBox Staging is a modern continuation of DOSBox with advanced features and
 current development practices. It emulates an Intel x86 PC running the MS-DOS
 operating system with the primary aim of running games, but most application
 programs will work as well.
 .
 It is meant as a (mostly) drop-in replacement for older DOSBox versions. Your
 existing configurations will continue to work, but you will have a ccess to
 many advanced features.
 .
 For the full list of supported features, please visit the DOSBox Staging
 website.
